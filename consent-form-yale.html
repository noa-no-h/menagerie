        <h1>CONSENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN A RESEARCH STUDY</h1>
        <h2>YALE UNIVERSITY</h2>
        <h2>Study Title: Factors influencing judgment/decision making</h2>
        <p>Principal Investigator (the person who is responsible for this research): Hedy Kober, hedy.kober@yale.edu</p>
        <h2>Research Study Summary:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We are asking you to join a research study.</li>
            <li>The purpose of this research study is to investigate how people make judgments and decisions, and how they understand their own decision-making processes.</li>
            <li>You must be 18 years of age or older to participate.</li>
            <li>Study activities will include completing a series of judgment and decision-making tasks, and answering questions about how you made your judgments and decisions.</li>
            <li>Your involvement will require 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>There may be some risks from participating in this study. You may experience mild discomfort from extended use of a mouse and keyboard, or from completing our judgment/decision-making tasks.</li>
            <li>The study may have no benefits to you.</li>
            <li>Taking part in this study is your choice. You can choose to take part, or you can choose not to take part in this study.  You also can change your mind at any time.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in learning more about the study, please continue reading the rest of this document. Once you understand the study, we will ask you if you wish to participate; if so, you will have to agree via this form.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why is this study being offered to me?</h2>
        <p>We are asking you to take part in a research study because you are between the ages of 18-65.  We are looking for 10,000 participants to be part of this research study.</p>
        <h2>Who is paying for the study?</h2>
        <p>Internal funding from Yale University awarded to Dr. Hedy Kober.</p>
        <h2>What is the study about?</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to better understand how people make judgments and decisions across a variety of contexts. We also are investigating how people understand their own decision-making processes, and how these processes are related to other individual differences between people.</p>
        <h2>What are you asking me to do and how long will it take?</h2>
        <p>If you agree to take part, your participation in this study will involve completing a series of online
            judgment/decision-making tasks. You will be asked to make decisions, and reflect on those 
            decisions. For example, you might also be asked to estimate facts about the world (e.g., the 
            average weight of a blue whale); read simple stories and make moral, causal, or logical 
            judgments about the people or statements in the stories; make fast judgments about which of 
            two numbers is bigger, or where shapes appeared on a screen; or memorize information and 
            recall facts about it. After making your judgments and decisions, we will ask you to describe how
            you made those decisions and answer questions about why you chose the things you did.</p>
        <p>We think that the study will take 45 minutes of your time.</p>
        <h2>Are there any risks from participating in this research?</h2>
        <p>If you decide to take part in this study, you may experience mild discomfort from using a mouse and keyboard for an extended period of time. You may also experience mild discomfort from completing some of our questionnaires.</p>
        <h2>How can the study possibly benefit me or others?</h2>
        <p>You may not benefit from taking part in this study. We hope that our results will add to the knowledge about how people make and think about their decisions.</p>
        <h2>Are there any costs to participation?</h2>
        <p>You will not have to pay for taking part in this study.</p>
        <h2>Will I be paid for participation?</h2>
        <p>You will be paid for taking part in this study. You will receive $12/hour, paid through the online platform from which you took this study (mTurk or Prolific). So in this study you will receive $8. </p>
        <h2>How will you keep my data safe and private?</h2>
        <p>The survey is anonymous. We will not know your name. We will not be able to connect any identifying information to your survey answers. However, we will know your mTurk/Prolific number in order to pay you for your time. Your mTurk/Prolific number could possibly be connected to your public profile, which could, in theory, be searched. We want to stress that we will not be looking at anyoneâ€™s public profiles. We will keep the information about your participation in this research confidential.</p>
        <h2>What if I want to refuse or end participation before the study is over?</h2>
        <p>Taking part in this study is your choice. You can choose to take part, or you can choose not to take part in this study.  You also can change your mind at any time.</p>
        <h2>Who should I contact if I have questions?</h2>
        <p>Please feel free to ask about anything you don't understand.</p>
        <p>If you have questions later or if you have a research-related problem, you can email, the Principal Investigator at hedy.kober@yale.edu.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or you would like to speak with someone other than the Principal Investigator or study team to discuss problems, concerns, or questions, or to obtain information or offer suggestions, you can call the Yale Institutional Review Boards at (203) 785-4688 or email hrpp@yale.edu.</p>
