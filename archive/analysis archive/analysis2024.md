## 3 I just tried to estimate what I would think a winter in the arctic and the shortest blue whale would look like. I know the arctic gets deadly cold, and that blue whales are huge, so I just assumed that there might be some slight deviation for blue whales, and that it gets colder than what I was given for the arctic question
