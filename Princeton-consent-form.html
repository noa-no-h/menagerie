        <h1>ADULT CONSENT FORM</h1>
        <h2>PRINCETON UNIVERSITY</h2>
        <h2>TITLE OF RESEARCH: Cognitive mechanisms of human learning and decision-making</h2>
        <p>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Molly Crockett</p>
        <p>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR'S DEPARTMENT: Psychology</p>
        <h2>Key information about the study:</h2>
        Your informed consent is being sought for research. Participation in the research is voluntary.<br><br>
        <u>The purpose of the research:</u> You are invited to take part in a research study designed to examine how
        people make social judgments and decisions. You are being asked to participate in this study because
        we are interested in these processes in a wide variety of people. The purpose of this study is to
        advance our understanding of how individual differences in cognitive functioning contribute to social
        behavior.<br><br>
        <u>The expected duration of the subject's participation:</u> The study will last approximately 40 minutes.<br><br>
        <u>The procedures that the subject will be asked to follow in the research:</u> If you agree to participate, you
        will be asked to make judgments or decisions about positive and negative outcomes for yourself and
        for other people, or to write brief descriptions of your own moral experiences. Afterwards, you will be
        asked questions related to your reactions to the events, as well as some personality traits and
        background variables that may affect information processing in these tasks. Due to the ongoing
        coronavirus pandemic, you may also be asked questions related to your experiences about the
        situation. You may withdraw from this study at any point by closing out of the browser window.
        Your participation will last between approximately 40 minutes. After
        completing the study, you will be compensated for your time by a member of the study staff.
        After completing this study, you may be invited to participate in one or more follow-up studies.
        Participating in the follow-ups is entirely optional. Invitations for these studies will be sent via email.
        <br><br>
        <u>The reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject as a result of participation:</u> Depending
        on the study you are participating in, you may be asked to imagine unpleasant scenarios, but these
        scenarios are no worse than what you might read about in a news story about a violent event such as a
        war or a natural disaster. These stimuli may be disturbing to you. Similarly, questions related to
        coronavirus may be stressful to you, but given that these topics are commonly discussed in everyday
        discourse (e.g., the news or social media), the information is no worse than what you would normally
        encounter in daily life. It is recommended that you should not complete this study if you suspect that
        you will be particularly sensitive to or negatively affected by such scenarios or questions. You will be
        alerted before you read such scenarios or questions, and you are free to withdraw from the study for
        any reason at any time.
        Additionally, you may be asked a series of questions about your mood and personality, as well as your
        emotions and social habits. Some of these questions may ask about sensitive information related to
        your mental and physical health, and could potentially trigger emotional reactions in some
        participants. For example, several standard mental health measures used in clinical research include
        questions about suicide. Responses to such questions indicating an immediate threat to self or others
        will be reported and require follow-up care.
        <br><br>
        <u>The benefits to the subject or to others:</u> Although this study will not benefit you personally, we hope
        that our results will add to the knowledge about how people make decisions about positive and
        negative outcomes for themselves and for other people.<br><br>
        <u>Eligibility:</u> In order to be eligible to participate in this study, you must be 18 years of age or older.<br><br>

        <h2>Additional information about the study:</h2>

        <u>Confidentiality:</u> All of your responses will be anonymous. Only the researchers involved in this study and those
        responsible for research oversight will have access to any information that you provide. Identifiers will
        be removed from identifiable private information. After such removal, the information will be used for
        future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without
        additional informed consent from the subject. Your responses will be kept private, and we will not
        include any information that will make it possible to identify you in any report we might publish.
        For some studies, we may ask your permission to share some of your data (e.g., descriptions of your
        own moral experiences) in a non-identifiable way with participants in future studies. You will have the
        option later in the study to withdraw your permission for us to share your de-identified data with other
        participants. Withdrawing this permission will not have any penalty.<br><br>

        <u>Compensation:</u>
        You will be paid $12/hour for your participation in this study. You may win additional money
        depending upon your choices and task performance. For tasks in which there is a reward, experimental
        bonus winnings will be determined either by selecting a subset of trials or by making your pay
        proportional to your task performance.

        <u>Who to contact with questions:</u>
        Principal investigator: Molly Crockett; mc5121@princeton.edu, crockett.laboratory@gmail.com<br><br>
