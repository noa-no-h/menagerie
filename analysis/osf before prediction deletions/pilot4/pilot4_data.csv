Then, we quantified each participant's accuracy by comparing their self-reported attribute weights to these best-fit attribute weights. Specifically, we computed the Pearson correlation between the self-reported weights and the best-fit weights across all attributes. We call this value the ""subject-level correlation"". Intuitively, a person who knew their own attribute weights really well would have a high correlation, and a person who did not know their own attribute weights would have a low correlation.



Imagine we ran this task with 300 U.S. subjects on Prolific, with a sample that was nationally representative for age, race, and gender. What do you predict would be the average subject-level correlation between the self-reported and best-fit attribute weights? - I predict the average subject-level correlation would be:","We described each heuristic in intuitive language, and asked participants to report whether they think they used that heuristic or not.



Then, after participants completed the study, we again fit a computational model to their choices and identified whether participants in fact used each heuristic.



What percentage of participants do you think correctly reported whether they used the heuristic or not, for all three heuristics? (If participants were choosing randomly, they would get all three heuristics right 17% of the time.) - I predict that the % of participants reporting all three heuristics correctly would be:","Prior to this study, had you heard of this ""Awareness of Choice Processes"" task before, or seen its results?","Last question.
