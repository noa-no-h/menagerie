                <p><b>What was this study about?</b>
                In this study, we're looking at how people justify their choices in basic judgment/estimation exercises.</p>
                <p><b>What was the hypothesis?</b>
                This research is exploratory; we do not have any specific hypotheses yet.</p>
                <p><b>Did we tell you everything?</b>
                The factors that we presented in the form of a scale from being affected by the factor in one direction to being affected by the factor in the other direction. These factors have been shown through past research to affect the decisions they pertained to. We were curious to see whether subjects would be able to identify the direction and strength of each effect.</p>
                <p><b>Why is this study important?</b>
                These insights are important for understanding how people introspect on their decision-making processes, and chart a potential path towards better human introspection.</p>
                <p><b>How to contact the researcher:</b>
                If you have questions or concerns about your participation or credit, or want to request a summary of research findings, please contact the research manager: Hedy Kober, hedy.kober@yale.edu.</p>
                <p><b>Whom to contact about your rights as a participant in this research:</b>
                For questions, concerns, suggestions, or complaints that have not been or cannot be addressed by the researcher, or to report research-related harm, please contact the Institutional Review Board by phone at (203) 785-4688 or by email at hrpp@yale.edu.</p>
