            <p><b>What was this study about?</b>
            In this study, we're looking at how people justify their choices in basic judgment/estimation exercises.</p>
            <p><b>What was the hypothesis?</b>
            This research is exploratory; we do not have any specific hypotheses yet.</p>
            <p><b>Did we tell you everything?</b>
            The factors that we presented in the form of "on a scale of 1-9, how much do you think (factor) influenced your decision" have been shown through past research to affect the decisions they pertained to. We were curious to see whether subjects would be able to identify this, and to what degree.</p>
            <p><b>Why is this study important?</b>
            These insights are important for understanding how people introspect on their decision-making processes, and chart a potential path towards better human introspection.</p>
